    "WhatsHitRate": "What’s Max X?",
    "WhatsHitRateContent": "Max X, also known as the maximum win multiplier, signifies the highest potential payout a slot game offers. This value represents how many times your initial bet you can win under ideal conditions. For instance, if a game has a Max X of 1200X, it means you could potentially win 1200 times your bet amount. This multiplier adds excitement and anticipation to gameplay, as players aim for the chance to achieve significant wins relative to their wagers.",
    "WhatIsRTP": "What’s RTP swing?",
    "WhatIsRTPContent": "RTP SWING real-time tool shows slot game’s fluctuation towards its own ideal RTP at a very exact moment of present (updates once in 5 min.).",
    "fluctuation": "What’s SPS?",
    "fluctuationContent": "SPS stands for Slot Profit Status, a real-time indicator displayed on our site to show whether a slot game's Live Return to Player (RTP) is greater than, less than, or equal to its Theoretical RTP.How is SPS calculated?SPS is represented as a percentage, reflecting the difference between the Live RTP and the Theoretical RTP. For example: If the Theoretical RTP is 97%, but the Live RTP is 120%, the SPS would be +23%, indicating that the slot game has paid out 23% more than expected. Conversely, if the Live RTP is 90%, the SPS would be -7%, indicating that the slot game has paid out 7% less than expected. How often is SPS updated? SPS is a live updating feature, with updates occurring every 5 minutes. This ensures that players have access to the most current information about a slot game's performance. Understanding the additional digits: In addition to the main SPS percentage, you may notice smaller digits beneath it. These smaller digits represent the change in SPS since the previous update. They can be either positive or negative, indicating whether the slot game has performed better or worse compared to the previous update. For example: If the previous SPS was 7%, and the new SPS is 5%, the smaller digits would display '-2%' in red, indicating a decrease in performance. If the next update shows an SPS of 6%, the smaller digits would display 1% in green, indicating an improvement compared to the previous update. We hope this helps you understand SPS better and enhances your experience on SlotStat.net!",
